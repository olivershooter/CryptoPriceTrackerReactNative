<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Built following along with the wonderful [notJust.dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYSa_YLoJokZAwHhlwJntIA). Their Youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6i02mJc8Zc)

A considerable amount of "documentation" in the form of comments before, after and sometimes in the middle of functions. This is for my own learning and thus might be considered ugly and/or fluff by a lot of people better than I. Idea is, if I can explain it I know it.

### Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [React Native Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage)
- [react-native-uuid](https://github.com/eugenehp/react-native-uuid)
- [react-native-wagmi-charts](https://github.com/coinjar/react-native-wagmi-charts)

## Getting Started

Simply fork or clone the repo.

## Future improvements

- Edit currently owned coins (maybe you bought some more and want to change them).
- Styles.js everywhere, just much cleaner than inline.
