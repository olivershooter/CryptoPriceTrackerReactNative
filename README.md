<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Built following along with the wonderful [notJust.dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYSa_YLoJokZAwHhlwJntIA). Their Youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6i02mJc8Zc)

A considerable amount of "documentation", i.e. comments before, after and sometimes in the middle of functions. This is for my own learning and thus might be considered ugly and/or fluff by a lot of people better than I. Idea is, if I can explain it I know it.

### Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)
